            <l>Her bleeding hands abroad,<annotation xml:id="a002"><bibl>Psalm 68:31.</bibl>In the <bibl>Old Testament</bibl>, Ethiopia refers not to the modern kingdom of <placeName>Ethiopia</placeName>, but to an ancient <placeName>Nubia</placeName>, the modern <placeName>Sudan</placeName>. In its nineteenth-century usage, the term "Ethiopian" referred more generally to people of African descent, rather than to the region or nation of <placeName>Ethiopia</placeName>more specifically.  According to the <bibl>Oxford English Dictionary</bibl>, the use of "Ethiop" to refer to " a black or dark-skinned person; a black African" dates to as early as the fourteenth century. This use was also prominent in other African American writing, as in that of <persName>Harper's</persName> predecessor, <persName>Phillis Wheatley</persName>, who refers to herself as "An Ethiop" in<bibl>To the University of Cambridge, in New England"(1773)</bibl></annotation></l>
