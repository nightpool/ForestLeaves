        <l>As you plough the trackless,<annotation xml:id="a0025">This line seems to be missing a word that would retain the rhyme and meter of the poem's other stanzas. Perhaps "trackless deep" is intended, as many writers of the period used that formulation to refer to the sea. The American poet <persName>Lydia H. Sigourney</persName>, for example, uses the phrase in <bibl><em>Traits of the Aborigines of America</em>(1822)</bibl>,<bibl>"To a Fragment of Cotton"(1841)</bibl>, and <bibl>"Sorrow as on the Sea"(1854).</bibl></annotation></l>

        <l>Your theme Immanuel.<annotation xml:id="a0026">Immanuel, from the Hebrew meaning "<persName>God </persName> is with us" or "may <persName>God</persName> be with us." The prophet <persName>Isaiah</persName> announces the birth of a child with the name (<bibl>Isaiah 7:10-17</bibl>). Christians would later take the name to predict the virgin birth of the Messiah, <persName>Jesus Christ</persName> (<bibl>Matthew 1:22</bibl>).</annotation></l>
