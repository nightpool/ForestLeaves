            <l>There's something strangely thrills my breast,</l>
            <l>And fills it with a deep unrest,--</l>
            <l>It is not grief, it is not pain</l>
            <l>Nor wish to live the past again</l>
        </lg>
        <lb/>
        <lg>
            <l>'Tis something which I scarce can tell,</l>
            <l>And yet I know, and feel it well;</l>
            <l>Thro'<expan>through</expan> ev'ry<expan>every</expan> vein it seems to run,</l>
            <l>And whispers life will soon be done.</l>
        </lg>
        <lb/>
        <lg>
            <l>It comes in accents soft and low,</l>
            <l>Like bright streamlets crystal flow,</l>
            <l>It whispers, lingers round my heart,</l>
            <l>And tells me I must soon depart</l>
        </lg>
        <lb/>
        <lg>
            <l>I felt it when the glow of life</l>
            <l>Was warm upon my cheek,</l>
            <l>In mournful cadence to my heart.</l>
            <l>It solemnly did speak.</l>
        </lg>
        <lb/>
        <lg>
            <l>I felt it when a fearful strife</l>
            <l>Was preying on my heart,</l>
            <l>It told me from the cares of life,</l>
            <l>I quickly must depart.</l>
        </lg>
        <lb/>
        <lg>
            <l>I felt it when my cheek grew pale,</l>
            <l>By cares I could'nt<expan> could not</expan> repress;</l>
            <l>It whisper'd<expan>whispered</expan> to my wearried soul.</l>
            <l>This earth is not your rest.</l>
