Naomi’s husband and sons (including Ruth’s husband) die and Naomi prepares to return to Bethlehem. Ruth chooses to remain with her mother-in-law and works to support her, rather than returning to her own people. Ruth’s marriage to Mahlon is considered a “mixed” marriage because Ruth is a Moabite and Naomi and her family are Jewish. This makes Ruth’s decision to remain with her mother-in-law even more significant (Ruth 1:9-22). Ruth goes on to marry Boaz, a wealthy landowner and relation of Naomi’s late husband. King David is one of their descendants (Ruth 2:1-4:22). Watkins revised this poem for the 1857 edition of <em>Poems on Miscellaneous Subjects</em>.</annotation>
