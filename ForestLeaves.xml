                        <bibl>Psalm 68:31.</bibl>In the <bibl>Old Testament</bibl>, Ethiopia refers not to the modern kingdom of <placeName>Ethiopia</placeName>, but to an ancient <placeName>Nubia</placeName>, the modern <placeName>Sudan</placeName>. In its nineteenth-century usage, the term "Ethiopian" referred more generally to people of African descent, rather than to the region or nation of <placeName>Ethiopia</placeName>more specifically.  According to the <bibl>Oxford English Dictionary</bibl>, the use of "Ethiop" to refer to " a black or dark-skinned person; a black African" dates to as early as the fourteenth century. This use was also prominent in other African American writing, as in that of <persName>Harper's</persName> predecessor, <persName>Phillis Wheatley</persName>, who refers to herself as "An Ethiop" in <bibl>To the University of Cambridge, in New England" (1773)</bibl>

                    <note xml:id="a019"> Naomi moves from Bethlehem to Moab with her husband and sons, one of whom marries Ruth, a Moabite woman. Naomi’s husband and sons (including Ruth’s husband) die and Naomi prepares to return to Bethlehem. Ruth chooses to remain with her mother-in-law and works to support her, rather than returning to her own people. Ruth’s marriage to Mahlon is considered a “mixed” marriage because Ruth is a Moabite and Naomi and her family are Jewish. This makes Ruth’s decision to remain with her mother-in-law even more significant (Ruth 1:9-22). Ruth goes on to marry Boaz, a wealthy landowner and relation of Naomi’s late husband. King David is one of their descendants (<bibl>Ruth 2:1-4:22</bibl>). Watkins revised this poem for the 1857 edition of <bibl style="font­-style: italic">Poems on Miscellaneous Subjects</bibl>.</note>
